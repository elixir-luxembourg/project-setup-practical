```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Abstract
I did some work and the result is:

### Todo
Code, rmd, project setup on github/gitlab? 
Participants need accounts - github classroom?
Reading of data from Zenodo
.gitignore

Messy directory setup on github?
Exercise: cleanup

Learning objectives

 * literature 
 * results from coding
 * setup
 * practice on git, 
 * Environment renv, 

## Introduction
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r peaks}
peaks <- read_delim("TC1-ST2-D0.12_peaks.narrowPeak", delim="\t", col_names = FALSE)

my_peaks <- read_delim("https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE75nnn/GSE75897/suppl/GSE75897_RPF_RPKMs.txt.gz", delim = "\t" , col_names = FALSE)

pp <- read_delim("https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSE75897&format=file", delim = "\t" )

```

## Methods


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(peaks) + geom_histogram( aes(X8))
```

## Results

We have discovered `r nrow(peaks)` peaks.

## Discussion
More research is needed.
